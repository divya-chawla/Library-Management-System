# Library-Management-System

A simple library Management system by which a student can issue a book.

To run this code:

First a menu will appear where you can chose any options from 1 to 9.

Some student record and book record are already created and can be checked through display "display student record " and "display book".

You can create your own student record through option 1( just enter student number and name) and you can check it in the list through option 2 i.e. display student record

Then you can create any book you want to issue, first by going to option 4 where you need to enter the book number(can be fictious) , name and author of the book.

To issue a book,just go to option 7 and type your student number and book number you created(you will see the record of the book)

Remember, you can only issue one book at a time otherwise it will display that you have not yet returned the previous book(this can be checked by putting std no -123456 )

To deposit a book ,enter the book number and number of days you kept the book with you(eg. 30)

If number of days is more than 20, then the fine will be displayed ($1 for each day after 20 days)

For eg. for(22 days , fine will be $2)
